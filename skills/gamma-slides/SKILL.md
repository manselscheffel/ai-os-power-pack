# Gamma Slides

Generate presentations from markdown content via the Gamma API.

## Process

### Step 1: Prepare Content

Structure the input as markdown with clear slide breaks:

```markdown
# Presentation Title

## Slide 1: Opening Hook
Key point or question to grab attention

## Slide 2: The Problem
- Pain point 1
- Pain point 2
- Why this matters

## Slide 3: The Solution
...
```

If the user provides rough notes, structure them into slides first.

### Step 2: Generate Presentation

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/gamma-slides/scripts/create_presentation.py --content content.md
```

**Process:**
1. Sends markdown to Gamma API
2. Gamma generates slides with professional design
3. Script polls for completion (can take 30-90 seconds)
4. Returns the live presentation URL

**Output**: JSON with `url` (live Gamma link), `id` (presentation ID), `title`

### Step 3: Present Results

Return the Gamma URL to the user. The presentation is:
- Immediately viewable and shareable
- Editable in Gamma's web editor
- Exportable to PDF or PowerPoint

## Edge Cases

- **Content too long**: Break into sections, suggest splitting into multiple decks
- **Gamma API timeout**: Retry once after 30 seconds
- **No GAMMA_API_KEY**: Tell user to add it to .env and provide setup link
- **Content too short**: Suggest adding more substance before generating

## Environment Variables

```
GAMMA_API_KEY          # Get from gamma.app
```

## Tips for Good Slides

- One key idea per slide
- Use bullet points, not paragraphs
- Include a clear hook/opening and strong close
- 8-15 slides is the sweet spot
- Let Gamma handle the design -- focus on content quality
